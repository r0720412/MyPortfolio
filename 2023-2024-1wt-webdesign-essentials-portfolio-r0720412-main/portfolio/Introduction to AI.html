            <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
           <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes activities like recognizing speech, translating languages, making decisions, and identifying objects. AI technology is rapidly evolving, transforming everything from healthcare to transportation.</p>

            <h3>The history of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>AI's history dates back to the mid-20th century, with foundational work by pioneers like Alan Turing, who proposed the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence. The field has evolved through various stages, from the development of simple algorithms to the creation of complex neural networks mimicking the human brain.</p>

            <h3>How does AI work?</h3>
            <p>At the heart of AI are algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions that computers follow to perform tasks. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, involves training these algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data. More advanced AI, known as Deep Learning, utilizes neural networks with many layers, allowing the computer to learn, adapt, and make decisions independently.</p>
